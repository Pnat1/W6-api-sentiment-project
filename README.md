## Description

The following project consists on becoming a data provider, by creating my own API which can receive information, store it, and serve it when needed.

In this project, I practice:

Flask (API creation)
SQL
NLTK (sentiment analysis)

Specifically the projects looks at the film script from Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction.


## Project Goals

Main goal: Create an API that:

Serves information to clients (in response to their GET requests).
Receives data from your clients (via their POST requests) and saves it to your own database.
Remember, YOU (your API) are the server, and clients send GET or POST requests to you.

(L0ü§î) Design the structure of your own database depending on the type of info you want to store.
(L1üßê) Write an API using flask to receive chat messages and store them in a database (mysql).
(L2ü•≥) Read and serve data from the chats database using different endpoints.
(L3ü§≠) Extract the emotional value of messages per user/chats and make it queryable through an endpoit.
(L4üî•) Do it real, use slack API to get messages and analyze the messages of our data-bootcamp channel.

## Example's - API Endpoints

# 1. Endpoints GET
(GET) /actors Returns every actor in the database.

(GET) /places Returns every place sent in every chat.


# 2. Endpoint POST
(POST) /chat/<chat_id> Creates a chat

(POST) /chat/<chat_id>/adduser Adds a user to a chat.

(POST) /chat/<chat_id>/message Adds a message from a user to a given chat.
